# The Plain (modified version)

## This is a modified version of the original [theme](https://github.com/heiswayi/the-plain) by Heiswayi Nrird. I modified the css to fit my site's need.

> The Plain is a minimalist Jekyll theme, ideally designed for your personal blog use. This Jekyll theme provides a minimum distraction so you can focus on writing that matters to you and your readers. This theme is originally inspired from [Leonard Lamprecht's _leo_ theme](https://github.com/leo/leo.github.io).
